## ðŸ“‚ ABOUT PROJECT:
> This project was developed for the Web Design discipline, during the first semester of my Technology in Systems Analysis and Development (TADS) course. Its objective is to create a website for the company GuaraLounge, located in Parnamirim, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil.

> Being my first project, it may not immediately reach the level of excellence I desire, but I am committed to improving it over time. My future objective is to use this project as a base for developing a shopping app for GuaraLounge, thus offering a more complete and integrated solution for the company.
